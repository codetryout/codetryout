### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the project CodeTryout.com. You can see the live project here, https://codetryout.com/ 
Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile


I have some updates. I am moving from Windows to Macbook, a Macbook M2 Apple silicon chip. I found VirtualBox does not support ARM processors after buying the Apple Macbook Pro. However, UTM came as a great solution, working as an alternative to VirtualBox. You can find the full tutorial here on how to run Virtual Machines on Apple M1 or M2 processors at CodeTryout notes:- https://codetryout.com/virtualbox-alternative-for-m1-m2-how-to-set-it-up/
See you soon!
